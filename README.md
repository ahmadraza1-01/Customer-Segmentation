Project Title: E-commerce Customer Segmentation & Sales Optimization
Domain: Business Analytics (E-commerce)
This project leverages SQL to analyze a large-scale e-commerce dataset to derive actionable business insights, focusing on customer behavior and sales performance.

## 1. Major Objectives
Analyze Sales Patterns: Identify temporal trends (monthly, weekly, daily) and top-performing product categories to understand business performance.
Customer Segmentation: Classify customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model.
Identify High-Value Customers: Pinpoint the most profitable customer segments that contribute disproportionately to revenue.
Provide Actionable Recommendations: Translate data insights into strategic recommendations for marketing, sales, and inventory management to boost revenue and customer retention.

## 2. Approaches & Methodology
The project was executed primarily within a SQL environment (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL) to handle data manipulation and analysis efficiently.
Data Exploration & Cleaning: Initial analysis involved using COUNT, DISTINCT, and WHERE clauses to check for NULL values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the customers, orders, and products tables.
Feature Engineering: New, valuable features were created directly in SQL. For example, OrderDate was used to extract Month and DayOfWeek, and TotalSale was calculated by multiplying Quantity and UnitPrice.
Advanced SQL for Analysis:
Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Used extensively to structure complex queries for the RFM analysis. A CTE was first built to calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value for each customer.
Window Functions: RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), and NTILE() were used to rank products by sales and to segment customers into RFM quartiles or quintiles. For example, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY recency_days DESC) was used to create recency score buckets.
Aggregate Functions & GROUP BY: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT() combined with GROUP BY were fundamental for calculating monthly sales revenue, average order value, and customer purchase frequency.
JOINs: Multiple tables (customers, orders, order_details, products) were joined to create a comprehensive analytical view linking customer data with their transaction history.

## 3. Results & Business Impact ðŸ’¡
The analysis yielded several key insights that translate directly into business value.
Key Finding 1 (Sales Trend): A significant sales surge of ~40% was identified during the last week of each financial quarter, indicating the success of targeted promotions.
Recommendation: Double down on quarter-end marketing campaigns and ensure optimal inventory for high-demand products during these periods.
Key Finding 2 (Product Performance): "Electronics" and "Home Appliances" categories together account for 65% of total revenue but only 30% of total transactions.
Recommendation: Focus marketing efforts and cross-selling strategies on these high-value categories. Consider bundling lower-value items with these popular products.
Key Finding 3 (Customer Segmentation): RFM analysis revealed that 18% of customers, classified as 'Champions' (high R, F, M scores), are responsible for 58% of the total revenue.
Recommendation: Launch a loyalty program or offer exclusive deals for this 'Champions' segment to maximize customer lifetime value (CLV) and reduce churn risk. Another segment, 'At Risk' customers (low Recency), should be targeted with personalized re-engagement campaigns. ðŸ“ˆ
